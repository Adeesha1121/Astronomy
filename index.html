    <section id="stars">
        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <p>Stars are celestial objects primarily composed of hydrogen and helium undergoing nuclear fusion in their cores, producing light and heat. Here are some key points about stars:</p>

        <h3>Sun</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our closest star, located at the center of the solar system.</li>
            <li>A G-type main-sequence star (G2V).</li>
            <li>Powers the solar system through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src=https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/ts-space-sun-and-solar-viewing-facts-versus-fiction.jpg?itok=4ANfdnv- alt="Sun Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>Stars are classified based on their spectral characteristics, mainly determined by temperature. The classification system is O, B, A, F, G, K, M (from hottest to coolest).</p>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jp3abiRQEw3swXGwT9c3Yj-970-80.jpg alt="Classification Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>Stars go through a life cycle that includes stages like nebula, protostar, main-sequence, red giant, and, for some, a supernova explosion, followed by a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.</p>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hi8sur3MJ7sMxzYxNzgzeb-970-80.jpg alt="Life Cycle Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Binary and Multiple Systems</h3>
        <p>Many stars exist in binary (two stars orbiting a common center of mass) or multiple systems. Some binary systems transfer mass between stars, leading to complex interactions and evolutionary paths.</p>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aSzsTniPim9cmaqHiJjVM5-970-80.jpg.webp alt="Binary Systems Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Star Clusters</h3>
        <p>Groups of stars that form together due to a common origin in a molecular cloud. Open clusters are loosely bound, while globular clusters are densely packed.</p>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZUsfgcXH7WMeVvuHYsoSA-650-80.png.webp alt="Star Clusters Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Variable Stars</h3>
        <p>Stars that exhibit variations in brightness over time. Types include Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae stars, and eclipsing binaries.</p>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8JeeV5CgKcEmLBs42PJQzf-650-80.jpg.webp alt="Variable Stars Placeholder Image">

        <h3>Neutron Stars and Black Holes</h3>
        <p>Formed from the remnants of massive stars after a supernova. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, while black holes have gravitational forces so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
        <img src=https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E15B/production/_119119675_20rainbowswirlrefracted.jpg alt="Neutron Stars and Black Holes Placeholder Image">


        <p>Understanding stars is fundamental to astrophysics, as they play a crucial role in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole. Ongoing research and advancements in observational technologies contribute to our expanding knowledge of stars and their properties.</p>

    <section id="galaxies">
        <h2>Galaxies</h2>
        <p>Stars are organized into galaxies, enormous systems containing billions to trillions of stars. Our Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy.</p>
        <img src=https://hubblesite.org/files/live/sites/hubble/files/home/science/galaxies/_images/STScI-H-galaxies-0639a-2400x1200.jpg alt="Galaxies Placeholder Image">
    
        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>Galaxies are classified into different types based on their shapes. The main classifications are spiral, elliptical, and irregular.</p>
      
        <img src=https://hubblesite.org/files/live/sites/hubble/files/home/science/galaxies/_images/STScI-H-galaxies-3types-2400x1200.jpg alt="Galaxy Evolution Image Placeholder" />

      
        <ul>
            <li>Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a central bulge and spiral arms.</li>
            <li>Elliptical galaxies are more elliptical in shape and lack distinct spiral arms.</li>
            <li>Irregular galaxies have irregular shapes and don't fit into the other categories.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Milky Way</h3>
        <img src=https://cdn.britannica.com/29/148329-050-269A9EFE/night-sky-Milky-Way-Galaxy.jpg alt="Milky Way Image Placeholder" />   
        <p>Our home galaxy, a barred spiral galaxy. Contains billions of stars, including our Sun, and various celestial objects. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a collection of galaxies.</p>
        
    
        <h3>Andromeda Galaxy (M31)</h3>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCXYB5YKXzdq2WEHYEe36d.jpg alt="Andromeda Galaxy Image Placeholder" />
        <p>The nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Expected to collide with the Milky Way in the distant future, forming a new galaxy.</p>
    
        <h3>Galactic Structures</h3>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeqQMMeMFxspQp7QRmQcJ5.jpg alt="Galactic Structures Image Placeholder" />
        <p>Galaxies can have structures like spiral arms, bars, and central bulges. The central region often harbors a supermassive black hole.</p>
    
        <h3>Clusters and Superclusters</h3>
        <img src=https://planetfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Supercluster.jpg alt="Galaxy Clusters Image Placeholder" />
        <p>Galaxies are not evenly distributed; they cluster together in groups and larger structures called superclusters. The Local Group is a small galaxy group that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda.</p>
        
        <!-- <h3>Dark Matter</h3>
        <img src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWiuSCNGSL8rfrBgE5PMcJ-650-80.jpg.webp alt="Galaxy Evolution Image Placeholder" />
        <p>The majority of a galaxy's mass is believed to be dark matter, a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light.</p>  -->
        
        <h3>Galaxy Evolution</h3>
        <img src=https://universe.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBWDg9IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ae3aaa797ea3a919bfc3fa322b375fb5599c8129/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--24997868381b1f10543ce76109cabaf03df01923/swift_M31_mosaic_1600.jpg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline alt="Galaxy Evolution Image Placeholder" />
        <p>Galaxies evolve over time through processes like mergers, collisions, and interactions with other galaxies. Observing distant galaxies allows astronomers to study them in different stages of their evolution.</p>
    
        <h3>Hubble's Law</h3>
        <p>The farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it appears to be receding. This observation led to the formulation of Hubble's law, suggesting the expansion of the universe.</p>
    
        <h3>Deep Field Observations</h3>
        <p>Telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope have conducted deep field observations, revealing a vast number of galaxies in seemingly empty regions of the sky.</p>
    
        <h3>Galaxy Formation</h3>
        <p>Galaxies are thought to have formed through the gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in the early universe.</p>
