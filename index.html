    <section id="stars">
        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <p>Stars are celestial objects primarily composed of hydrogen and helium undergoing nuclear fusion in their cores, producing light and heat. Here are some key points about stars:</p>
    
        <h3>Sun</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our closest star, located at the center of the solar system.</li>
            <li>A G-type main-sequence star (G2V).</li>
            <li>Powers the solar system through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>Stars are classified based on their spectral characteristics, mainly determined by temperature. The classification system is O, B, A, F, G, K, M (from hottest to coolest).</p>
    
        <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>Stars go through a life cycle that includes stages like nebula, protostar, main-sequence, red giant, and, for some, a supernova explosion, followed by a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.</p>
    
        <h3>Binary and Multiple Systems</h3>
        <p>Many stars exist in binary (two stars orbiting a common center of mass) or multiple systems. Some binary systems transfer mass between stars, leading to complex interactions and evolutionary paths.</p>
    
        <h3>Star Clusters</h3>
        <p>Groups of stars that form together due to a common origin in a molecular cloud. Open clusters are loosely bound, while globular clusters are densely packed.</p>
    
        <h3>Variable Stars</h3>
        <p>Stars that exhibit variations in brightness over time. Types include Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae stars, and eclipsing binaries.</p>
    
        <h3>Neutron Stars and Black Holes</h3>
        <p>Formed from the remnants of massive stars after a supernova. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, while black holes have gravitational forces so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
    
        <h3>Galaxies</h3>
        <p>Stars are organized into galaxies, enormous systems containing billions to trillions of stars. Our Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy.</p>
    
        <h3>Stellar Spectra</h3>
        <p>By analyzing the light emitted by stars, astronomers can determine their composition, temperature, density, mass, and relative motion.</p>
    
        <h3>Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram</h3>
        <p>A graph that correlates the luminosity and temperature of stars, revealing patterns and evolutionary stages.</p>
    
        <h3>Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h3>
        <p>The process by which stars create new elements through nuclear fusion in their cores.</p>
    
        <p>Understanding stars is fundamental to astrophysics, as they play a crucial role in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole. Ongoing research and advancements in observational technologies contribute to our expanding knowledge of stars and their properties.</p>
